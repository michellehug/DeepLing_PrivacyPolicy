Privacy Policy – DeepLing (Alpha Test)
Developer: Jonathan Cooper (DeepLingDev)
Last updated: January 2026

This Privacy Policy applies to the DeepLing mobile application (Alpha Test). It explains how information is handled during testing.

Information We Collect
DeepLing does not collect personal data.
There are no user accounts, no logins, no email collection, and no identity data.
The app only plays audio; it does not record or store microphone input.
All learning content and progress data is stored locally on the user’s device.

Microphone Access
DeepLing does not record, store, or transmit audio input.
If microphone access is used for speech features, audio is processed in real time only and is never stored, saved, or retained by the app or developer.

Third-Party Services
DeepLing uses Google Firebase and Gemini AI services strictly to facilitate technical API functionality.
While DeepLing does not collect or store personal information, these third-party services may process technical identifiers (such as IP addresses) necessary to fulfill API requests. This data is not accessible to the developer and is not used for tracking, profiling, or identification.
For more information, users may refer to Google’s Privacy Policy.

Analytics and Tracking
No analytics services are used.
No tracking, profiling, or behavioral monitoring is performed.

Advertising
DeepLing does not show ads.

Data Sharing
No data is sold, shared, or transferred to third parties.

Children’s Privacy
DeepLing is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.

Legal Basis (GDPR – EU)
DeepLing does not process personal data. Any technical processing required for API communication is limited to functional operation only.

CCPA (US – California)
DeepLing does not collect, sell, or share personal information as defined by the CCPA.

Data Storage
All app data remains on the user’s device during the alpha test.

Data Deletion
Users can delete all local app data at any time by clearing the app’s cache/data in their device settings or by uninstalling the application.

User Rights
Because no personal data is collected or stored by DeepLing, there is no personal data to access, export, or delete from developer systems.

Changes
This policy may be updated as the app evolves beyond alpha testing.
